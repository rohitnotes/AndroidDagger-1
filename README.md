* ** ViewModel is injected using a concept named Multi Binding.
* ** @Singleton is used to application level dependency, it will stay as long a application exists, and it should be static when it is possible

* ** @Provides and @Binds annotations are same, when we have a method body we use @Binds andwhen the method body is missing the we use @Provides
